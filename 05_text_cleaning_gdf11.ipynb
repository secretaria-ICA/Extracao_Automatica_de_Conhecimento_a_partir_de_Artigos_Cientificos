(e-mail: ). the bones that comprise the axial skeleton have distinct morphological features characteristic of their positions along the anterior/posterior axis. we previously described a novel tgf-β family member, myostatin (encoded by the gene mstn, formerly gdf8), that has an essential role in regulating skeletal muscle mass1. we also identified a gene related to mstn by low-stringency screening1. while the work described here was being completed, the cloning of this gene, designated gdf11 (also called bmp11), was also reported by other groups2,3. here we show that gdf11, a new transforming growth factor β (tgfβ) superfamily member, has an important role in establishing this skeletal pattern. during early mouse embryogenesis, gdf11 is expressed in the primitive streak and tail bud regions, which are sites where new mesodermal cells are generated. homozygous mutant mice carrying a targeted deletion of gdf11 exhibit anteriorly directed homeotic transformations throughout the axial skeleton and posterior displacement of the hindlimbs. the effect of the mutation is dose dependent, as gdf11+/− mice have a milder phenotype than gdf11−/− mice. mutant embryos show alterations in patterns of hox gene expression, suggesting that gdf11 acts upstream of the hox genes. our findings suggest that gdf11 is a secreted signal that acts globally to specify positional identity along the anterior/posterior axis. by whole-mount in situ hybridization of early mouse embryos, we detected very faint expression of gdf11 at 7.5 days post-coitum (dpc; late presomite stage) in the posterior half of the embryo (data not shown). we observed expression of gdf11 at 8.0−8.25 dpc in the primitive streak region, where ingressing cells of the epiblast form the mesoderm of the developing embryo (a). by analysing horizontal sections prepared from these embryos, we localized gdf11 mrna to the neural epithelium in more anterior regions and to the neural epithelium and mesoderm in more posterior regions (d−f). gdf11 continued to be expressed in the primitive streak region at 9.0 dpc (b), but by 9.5 dpc (approximately the time when the tail bud replaces the primitive streak as the source of new mesodermal cells4) gdf11 was expressed predominantly in the tail bud (c). hence at these early stages, gdf11 is transcribed in the region of the developing embryo where new mesodermal cells arise, consistent with previous reports2,3. to determine the biological function of gdf11, we used homologous targeting to generate gdf11-null mice (a,b). among 807 adult mice derived from crosses of gdf11+/− mice, we found no gdf11−/− offspring. genotype analysis of 219 newborn mice, however, revealed 51 (23%) gdf11–/– mice, which are recognizable by their shortened or absent tails (c). all gdf11–/– mice died within 24 hours after birth. the precise cause of death is unknown, but nearly all mutants had a range of palate and renal anomalies (data not shown). mutant animals had skeletal abnormalities that appeared to represent homeotic transformations of vertebral segments in which particular vertebrae had a morphology typical of more anterior segments (table 1). anterior transformations of the vertebrae were most apparent in the thoracic region, where there was an increase in the number of thoracic (t) segments (a). all wild-type mice examined had 13 thoracic vertebrae, each with its associated pair of ribs. in contrast, all gdf11–/– mice examined had 4 or 5 extra pairs of ribs, for a total of 17 or 18 thoracic vertebrae. hence, segments normally corresponding to lumbar (l) vertebrae l1 to l4 or l5 were transformed into thoracic segments in gdf11–/– animals. we also observed transformations within the thoracic region in which one thoracic vertebra had a morphology characteristic of another thoracic vertebra. for example, in gdf11+/+ mice, the first seven pairs of ribs are attached to the sternum, and the remaining six are unattached or free. in gdf11–/– mice, the number of attached pairs of ribs was increased to 10 or 11 (b), suggesting that segments t8 to t10 or t11 were transformed into more anterior thoracic segments. consistent with this finding, the transitional spinous process and the transitional articular processes, which are normally found on t10, were instead found on t13 in gdf11–/– mutants (c,d). similarly, the long spinous process normally present on t2 was shifted to t3 (f), and in several gdf11–/– mutants the ribs derived from t2 appeared to have a morphology typical of t1, in that they extended to touch the top of the sternum. expression of gdf11 in mouse embryos. whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis was carried out in 8.25 (a), 9.0 (b) and 9.5 (c) dpc mouse embryos. note the expression in the

cervical (c) vertebrae, we observed transformations in this region in some mutants. the most anterior transformation found was at the level of c6. in wild-type mice, c6 was identifiable by the presence of two anterior tuberculi on the ventral side. in some gdf11–/– mice, one or two anterior tuberculi were present on c7, usually in addition to one or two on c6 (f). hence, in these mice, c7

july 1999 c6 appeared to have been at least partially transformed to have a morphology resembling that of c6 and c5, respectively. transformations of the axial skeleton also extended into the lumbar region. whereas gdf11+/+ animals normally have only 6 lumbar vertebrae, gdf11–/– mice had 7–9 (e), at least 6 of which must have derived from segments that would normally correspond to sacral and caudal vertebrae. hence, gdf11–/– mice had 6−8 additional presacral vertebrae, which was also evident from the posterior displacement of the hindlimbs relative to the forelimbs (a). in the sacral and caudal regions, the exact nature of the abnormalities was not as readily identifiable, as the vertebrae were severely malformed with extensive fusions of cartilage. the total number of vertebrae in this region, however, was reduced from the normal number (∼ 34). gdf11+/− mice also showed abnormalities in the axial skeleton, although the phenotype was milder than in gdf11−/− mice. gdf11+/– mice showed the presence of an additional thoracic segment with an associated pair of ribs (a), which was almost always attached to the sternum (b). hence, t8 appeared to have been transformed to a more anterior thoracic segment, and l1 appeared to have been transformed to a posterior thoracic segment. to varying degrees, we observed other abnormalities indicative of anterior transformations in gdf11+/– mice. these included a shift of the long spinous process characteristic of t2 by one segment to t3, a shift of the transitional articular and spinous processes from t10 to t11, an asymmetric

table 1). to understand the basis for these abnormalities in axial patterning, we examined mutant embryos isolated at various stages of development. by 10.5−11.5 dpc, we could distinguish gdf11–/– and most gdf11+/– embryos from wild type by the posterior displacement of the developing hindlimb (by 4 somites and 1 somite, respectively; b). to determine whether the mutant phenotype was caused by an effect on the rate of somite formation, we counted the total number of somites in gdf11+/+ and gdf11–/– embryos isolated between 9.5 and 10.5 dpc. the number of somites at any given developmental stage was approximately the same between gdf11+/+ and gdf11–/– embryos (c). these data suggest that the abnormalities represent true transformations of segment identities rather than the insertion of additional segments by an enhanced rate of somitogenesis. there is considerable evidence that positional identity along the anterior/posterior axis is specified by the spatially restricted expression patterns of hox genes (for review, see refs 5−7). to determine whether changes in patterns of hox gene expression could account for the transformations seen in gdf11−/− animals, we examined the expression patterns of four representative hox genes. for both hoxc6 and hoxc8, the paraxial mesodermal expression domains expanded posteriorly in gdf11–/– embryos. by in situ hybridization analysis at 12.5 dpc using either embryo sections (c,d,g,h) or whole mounts (data not shown), we determined that the posterior boundaries of expression for both genes were displaced caudally by approximately 2 or 3 prevertebrae in gdf11–/– embryos. at all stages examined between 9.5 and 12.5 dpc, however, the anterior boundaries of hoxc6 and hoxc8 expression domains were similar in gdf11+/+ and gdf11–/–

nature genetics volume 22 july 1999 hoxc10 and hoxc11, the gdf11 mutation caused the entire expression domains to be shifted posteriorly. the anterior boundary of the hoxc10 expression domain appeared similar in gdf11+/+ and gdf11–/– embryos relative to the hindlimbs (i,j), which were displaced posteriorly in gdf11–/– embryos (b). the analysis of hoxc11 was complicated by the fact that prevertebral expression was delayed in mutants (note the faint signal in mutant (l) relative to wild-type (k) embryos at 11.5 dpc), consistent with the observation that the hindlimbs developed later in gdf11–/– than gdf11+/+ embryos (data not shown). based on an examination of embryos between 11.5 and 13.5 dpc, however, the prevertebral expression of hoxc11 appeared to be shifted posteriorly relative to not only the forelimbs but also the hindlimbs (m,n). these alterations in hox gene expression provide further evidence that the skeletal abnormalities seen in gdf11–/– animals represent homeotic transformations and that gdf11 acts upstream of the hox genes to regulate axial patterning. the expression pattern of gdf11 and the phenotype of gdf11–/– mice suggest that gdf11 acts either directly or indirectly on mesodermal precursor cells to specify positional identity along the anterior/posterior axis. the intermediate phenotype observed in gdf11+/– mice also suggests that the ability of gdf11 to influence axial patterning is concentration dependent. this is consistent with a variety of different models for gdf11 action, including a morphogen model. whatever the mechanism of action of gdf11, it is tempting to speculate that either changing local concentrations of gdf11 or differences in the competence of target cells to respond to gdf11 may be partly responsible for progressively more posterior identities being conferred on cells generated at progressively later stages of development. an elucidation of the mechanism of action of gdf11 will require the identification of gdf11 receptors and an analysis of their distribution. in this regard, additional thoracic vertebrae and a range of kidney defects have been observed to a milder degree in mice lacking the activin type iib receptor8 (actriib). the similarities in these phenotypes raise the possibility that actriib may be a receptor for gdf11, although differences in the phenotypes suggest that actriib cannot be the sole receptor for gdf11 and that gdf11 cannot be the sole ligand for actriib in vivo. to our knowledge, gdf11 is the first secreted protein factor that has been shown to function globally to regulate anterior/posterior axial patterning. in fact, the homeotic transformations observed in gdf11 mutant mice are more extensive than those seen thus far either by genetic manipulation of presumed patterning genes (for review, see refs 5−7) or by administration of retinoic acid (for review, see ref. 9). it will be important to investigate whether gdf11 and retinoic acid interact to regulate hox gene expression and anterior/posterior patterning and whether gdf11 regulates the patterning of tissues other than those described here. methods cloning of gdf11 and construction of gdf11–/– mice. mouse 129/svj and human genomic libraries were made in λ fix ii, and a human spleen cdna library was made in λ zap ii (stratagene) according to instructions from the manufacturer. we obtained gdf11 sequences by low-stringency screening of these libraries using a mstn probe. we carried out library screening, rna isolation and poly(a) selection as described10. we deduced the structure of gdf11 from restriction mapping and partial sequencing of genomic phage clones. vectors for preparing the targeting construct were kindly provided by p. soriano and k. thomas. r1 es cells from strain 129/svj

counting, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated to methanol and cleared in 1:1 benzyl alcohol:benzyl benzoate. we carried out whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis using digoxigenin-labelled probes as described11, except blocking and antibody incubation steps were as in knecht et al.12. for analysis of gdf11 expression patterns, we used probes corresponding to the proregion and 3´ utr to avoid cross-hybridization to mstn. after hybridization some embryos were frozen in oct, and cryostat sections (40 µm) were taken. we carried out in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labelled hoxc6 and hoxc8 riboprobes on frozen sections (20 µm) of 12.5 dpc embryos as described13. antibody incubation was carried out at 4 oc overnight as described14. hoxc6, hoxc8 and

whitman, 1998). much of our knowledge of the biology of bmp/tgf-b factors comes from analysis of early developmental events in xenopus. for example, in the gastrulating xenopus w b 1 to whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed. fax: 498-8875. e-mail: . 222 mbryo, different classes of tgf-b superfamily ligands are elieved to be involved in patterning of both dorsal and entral mesoderm. factors such as activin, vg-1, and the enopus nodal-related molecules (xnrs), have been shown o induce dorsal types of mesoderm such as muscle and otochord (reviewed in slack, 1994;

piccolo et al., 1996). follistatin is a potent inhibitor of ctivin and blocks its signaling by physically sequestering he protein (nakamura et al., 1990). it has recently been shown that follistatin can also block the activity of bmps 2, 4, and 7 by forming a trimeric complex with bmp and its receptor (iemura et al., 1998). these data suggest that during early developmental events, there is not only active patterning by factors like bmps but also selective inactivation of their signaling pathways by secreted antagonists. in a search for novel bmp/tgf-b-like molecules, we isolated bmp-11 by a low stringency screen using a bmp-7 probe. bmp-11 is a novel member of the bmp/tgf-b superfamily and is most closely related to gdf-8/ myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth (mcpherron et al., 1997). in order to determine the function of bmp-11, we characterized its expression pattern during mouse embryogenesis and analyzed bmp-11 protein activity in xenopus embryos. our data suggest a role for bmp-11 in mesodermal and neural patterning in the vertebrate embryo. materials and methods isolation of bmp-11. in order to search for novel bmp-like olecules, a probe containing the cysteine-rich mature region nucleotides 1081–1392) of human bmp-7 was used to screen a bovine genomic library under reduced stringency conditions (final wash 43 ssc/0.1% sds at 60°c). positives from this screen were rescreened with a mixed probe corresponding to the mature regions of human bmps 5, 6, and 7 under high stringency conditions (final ash 0.23 ssc/0.1% sds at 65°c). clones which hybridized to the bmp7 probe under reduced stringency conditions but not to the bmp 5, 6, 7 probe mix at high stringency were further characterzed. one of these clones, 7r-30, contained a novel bovine bmpelated sequence designated bmp-11. this bovine bmp-related sequence was used to design oligonucleotides, which were used to pcr a human bmp-11-specific sequence from a human genomic library (stratagene, inc.). the human bmp-11 sequence was then used as a probe to screen human fetal cdna and human genomic libraries to derive the full-length sequence of human bmp-11. the mature region of human bmp-11 was then used to screen a mouse genomic library (stratagene, inc.) to generate full-length clones and sequence for mouse bmp-11. the nucleotide sequences of human bmp-11 and mouse bmp-11 have been deposited in the genbank equence database. whole mount in situ hybridization. whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as described (hogan et al., 1994) with minor modifications (herbert neuhaus, personal communication). the mouse bmp-11 probe was a 261-bp fragment derived from the 59 end of the propeptide region of a bmp-11 cdna. following subcloning into pgem-3, sense and antisense digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes were produced using sp6 and t7 rna polymerase. whole mount-stained embryos were processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 10 mm, and counterstained with eosin as described (hogan et al., 1994). m a copyright © 1999 by academic press. all right embryological methods. xenopus eggs were fertilized in vitro, nd embryos were reared by standard methods (kay and peng, 991). staging was according to nieuwkoop and faber . nimal cap ectoderm was isolated from stage 8–9 blastulae and ultured in 0.5 3 mmr and 0.5% bovine serum albumin with or ithout protein factors until the late gastrula stage. the explants ere then transferred to 0.753 nam for long-term culture. recominant human bmp-11, mouse noggin, and human activin a were xpressed and produced as previously described (heine et al., 1987;

umbhauer et al., 1995). given the recent evidence that bmps can also activate the map kinase pathway (shibuya et al., 1998), we wanted to determine if bmp-11 was working like activin or fgf to form mesoderm in animal caps. to do this, we treated late blastula stage animal caps with activin (2 ng/ml), fgf (50 ng/ml), and bmp-11 (20 ng/ml) for 2 h (until stage 10.5) and then assayed for the induction of mix.1, a gene that responds to activin, vg-1, and bmp-4, but not to fgf (rosa, 1989; huang et al., 1995; mead et al., 1996). as expected, activin induced the expression of mix.1, while fgf did not (b). interestingly, using a relatively low dose of bmp11, we readily detected the induction of mix.1 gene expression (b). these data suggest that in the xenopus embryo, bmp-11 acts more like activin and the tgf-b class of mesoderm inducers. follistatin but not noggin inhibits bmp-11 activity in xenopus embryos, three secreted factors, noggin, chordin, and follistatin, have been shown to mimic the two main activities of spemann’s organizer: neural induction and dorsalization of mesoderm, by blocking the activities of bmp/tgf-b ligands (reviewed in harland and gerhart, 1997; thomsen, 1997). to determine if any of these antagonists could block bmp-11 activity, we used the animal cap assay. blastula stage explants were treated with bmp-11 protein (50 ng/ml) alone or with a mixture of bmp-11 (50 ng/ml) and mouse noggin (1000 ng/ml) or human follistatin (500 ng/ml) and cultured until late neurula (stage 22). noggin, at a 20-fold molar excess, does not block the s of reproduction in any form reserved. i t d t t t m h m t m c n a g t c trea 227novel bmp in xenopus embryos elongation of animal caps caused by bmp-11, and does not inhibit bmp-11 induction of the dorsal mesoderm marker, muscle actin (figs. 5b and 5c). the noggin protein used for this assay was active as animal caps incubated in noggin alone at 1000 ng/ml induced the neural marker, ncam (d). in contrast, follistatin was able to completely inhibit bmp-11-mediated elongation of animal caps at a 10-fold molar excess (f). moreover, follistatin abolished bmp-11 induction of muscle actin in animal caps (g). in binding experiments, neither noggin nor chordin protein interacted specifically with bmp-11, while follistatin showed significant binding to the bmp-11 protein (l. fitz and s. cook, unpublished observations). bmp-11 induces dorsal and posterior neural genes and modifies the neural tissue induced by noggin . morphological and histological analysis of control and b explants were treated with 200 ng/ml of recombinant human bmpfor histology (c, d).

reshef et l., 1998). based on the above observation, and the expresion pattern and activity of bmp-11, we suggest that bmp-11 may also function as a mediator of somite formation, perhaps by modulating sclerotome or dermomyotome differentiation along with other bmps. the activity of bmp-11 on xenopus ectodermal explants is most similar to that seen with activin treatment, including induction of dorsal mesoderm and neural tissue. since bmp-11 is more structurally similar to the inhibin/activin class of tgf-b molecules and because bmp ligands can signal through different receptor combinations (reviewed in massague, 1998), the activity of bmp-11 could reflect its signaling through an activin type ii receptor and downstream activation of the smad2 pathway. this is most likely the case, as we have found no homologous sequences to bmp-11 in xenopus by genomic southern analysis (l. gamer, unpublished observations). to further investigate this hypothesis, we are currently conducting studies to determine whether the actions of bmp-11 can be blocked by overexpressing dominant negative activin type i and type ii receptor constructs in xenopus embryos. using the animal cap assay, we also found that bmp-11 activity was specifically blocked by follistatin, but not by noggin. this interaction between bmp-11 and follistatin may be meaningful during development as the expression patterns of both genes localize to adjacent domains in certain regions of the mouse embryo. bmp-11 is expressed in the dorsal lateral neural tube at a time when follistatin is detected in the adjacent somites (feijen et al., 1994). in addition, bmp-11 is expressed around the precartilaginous condensations when follistatin is expressed in those condensing cartilages in the limb (feijen et al., 1994). taken together our data suggest that follistatin may be involved in limiting bmp-11 activity during somitogenesis and limb development in a manner similar to the way noggin modifies bmp-4 activity in the somite and limb (mcmahon et al., 1998; reshef et al., 1998; capdevila and johnson, 1998). s of reproduction in any form reserved. f d t l m a a s m g s d b e c d f g g h h l l m 231novel bmp in xenopus embryos recent evidence suggests that follistatin may inhibit bmp activity by a mechanism that is different from noggin and chordin (iemura et al., 1998). we do not yet know how ollistatin antagonizes bmp-11, but binding studies to adress this question should be possible upon the identificaion of a bmp-11 receptor. bmp-11 is highly related to gdf-8/myostatin, a factor recently shown to be an important negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass (mcpherron et al., 1997). interestingly, like other highly related bmps such as bmp-2 and bmp-4, bmp-11 and gdf-8 proteins appear to have similar activity in the xenopus animal cap assay (l. gamer, unpubished observations). this suggests that these two factors ay be binding to the same or a similar receptor and using n analogous signaling pathway. although these factors ppear to have similar activities, bmp-11 cannot compenate for the loss of gdf-8 in homozygous null animals. this ay reflect their mutually exclusive expression domains as df-8 is specifically expressed in developing somites and keletal muscle (mcpherron et al., 1997), where we do not etect any bmp-11 transcripts. these data suggest that mp-11 and gdf-8 adopted different functions as they volved from a common ancestral gene. acknowledgments we thank amanda frisch for excellent technical advice with rt-pcr, diane peluso for animal cap histology, jennifer dube and adele pearson for mouse bmp-11 in situ probes, and herbert neuhaus, paul yaworsky, and lisa-anne whittemore for critical reading of the manuscript. references blitz, i. l., and cho, k. w. . anterior neurectoderm is progressively induced during gastrulation: the role of the xenopus homeobox gene orthodenticle. development 121, 993–1004. bronner-fraser, m. . neural crest cell formation and migration in the developing embryo. faseb j. 8, 699–706. bronner-fraser, m., and fraser, s. e. . differentiation of the vertebrate neural tube. curr. opin. cell biol. 9, 885–891. capdevila, j., and johnson, r. l. . endogenous and ectopic expression of noggin suggests a conserved mechanism for regulation of bmp function during limb and somite patterning. dev. biol. 197, 205–217. cox, w. g., and hemmati-brivanlou, a. . caudalization of neural fate by tissue recombination and bfgf. development 121, 4349–4358. urrie, p. d., and ingham, p. w. . the generation and interpretation of positional information within the vertebrate myotome. mech. dev. 73, 3–21. oniach, t. . basic fgf as an inducer of anteroposterior neural pattern. cell 83, 1067–1070. eijen, a., goumans, m. j., and van den eijnden-van raaij, a. j. m. . expression of activin subunits, activin receptors and follistatin in postimplantation mouse embryos suggests specific developmental functions for different activins. development 120, 3621–3637. copyright © 1999 by academic press. all right otoh, y., masuyama, n., suzuki, a., ueno, n., and nishida, e. . involvement of the map kinase cascade in xenopus mesoderm induction. embo j. 14, 2491–2498. raff, j. m. . embryonic patterning: to bmp or not to bmp, that is the question. cell 89, 171–174. arland, r. m., and gerhart, j. c. . formation and function of spemann’s organizer. annu. rev. cell dev. biol. 13, 611–667. eine, u. i., munoz, e. f., flanders, k. c., ellingsworth, l. r., lam, h. y. p., thompson, n. l., roberts, a. b., and sporn, m. b. . role of transforming growth factor-b in the development of the mouse embryo. j. cell biol. 105, 2861–2876. hemmati-brivanlou, a., and melton, d. a. . inhibition of activin receptor signaling promotes neuralization in xenopus. cell 77, 273–281. hermann, b. g. . action of the brachyury gene in mouse embryogenesis: postimplantation development in the mouse. ciba found. symp. 165, 78–91. hogan, b., beddington, r., costantini, f., and lacy, e. . “manipulating the mouse embryo,” 2nd ed. cold spring harbor laboratory press, cold spring harbor. hogan, b. . bone morphogenetic proteins: multifunctional regulators of vertebrate development. genes dev. 10, 1580– 1594. hopwood, n. d., pluck, a., and gurdon, j. b. . a xenopus mrna related to drosophila twist is expressed in response to induction in the mesoderm and the neural crest. cell 59, 893– 903. huang, h. c., murtaugh, l. c., vize, p. d., and whitman, m. . identification of a potential regulator of early transcriptional responses to mesoderm inducers in the frog embryo. embo j. 23, 5965–5973. iemura, s-i., yamamoto, t. s., takagi, c., uchiyama, h., natsume, t., shimasaki, s., sugino, h., and ueno, n. . direct binding of follistatin to a complex of bone-morphogenetic protein and its receptor inhibits ventral and epidermal fates in early xenopus embryo. proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 95, 9337–9342. kay, b. k., and peng, h. b.

hitman, 1998). in the mouse, mutation of tgfb-related ligands, their receptors, and cytoplasmic signaling components has demonstrated multiple roles for tgfb pathways n the events of gastrulation and pattern formation (bedington and robertson, 1999). embryos with mutations in ype i tgfb receptors, including alk2, alk3, and alk4, ave defects in gastrulation and mesoderm formation mishina et al., 1995; gu et al., 1998, 1999). type ii tgfb receptors are also required for gastrulation and embryos mutant for both the actriia and the actriib genes, or for the bmprii gene, fail to gastrulate or form mesoderm (song et al., 1999; beppu et al., 2000). mutations in smad2 and smad4 demonstrate that these downstream components are also involved in axis and mesoderm formation (nomura 495 w t e s n l i e k s a t a e f l c l c l n c o c s e f 1 t a a t g e t r b s 1 1 p o b x s 496 wall et al. and li, 1998; sirard et al., 1998; waldrip et al., 1998; einstein et al., 1998; yang et al., 1998). although many mutations have been generated in tgfb ligands that disrupt gastrulation, none of these mutations have a complete absence of mesoderm. mutations in the activinba and activinbb genes result in mice that survive o term (matzuk et al., 1995a,b). although nodal mutant mbryos have defects in gastrulation related to primitive treak maintenance, some mesoderm is present and odal2/2 es cells can form differentiated mesoderm (conon et al., 1994). embryos mutant for bmp2 or bmp4 nitiate gastrulation normally and form mesoderm (winnier t al., 1995; zhang and bradley, 1996; lawson et al., 1999; anzler et al., 2000). even though disruption of tgfb signaling results in defects in mesoderm induction and axis formation, none of the individual tgfb ligand mutants how a complete absence of these early gastrulation events, nd the analysis of compound mutants effecting gastrulaion has so far been limited. clearly, the isolation and nalysis of additional mammalian tgfb ligands is required to further elucidate the role of tgfb signaling in the mouse mbryo. tgfb signaling is also implicated in left–right (l/r) axis ormation (burdine and schier, 2000; capdevila et al., 2000). oss-of-function and chimera analyses in the mouse indiate that the tgfb-related ligands, nodal, lefty1, and efty2, as well as the downstream components actriib, ryptic, smad2, and smad5, regulate l/r patterning (colignon et al., 1996; oh and li, 1997; meno et al., 1998; omura and li, 1998; gaio et al., 1999; heyer et al., 1999; hang et al., 2000). nodal, lefty1, and lefty2 are expressed n the left and current models of l/r patterning in the hick embryo implicate an activin-like factor, acting uptream of the asymmetric genes, in breaking symmetry to stablish the l/r axis. the identity of this upstream tgfb ligand is yet to be determined, but recent analyses suggest that the tgfb-related gene, gdf1, maybe act early in l/r patterning (rankin et al., 2000; this work). xenopus vg1 (xvg1) was among the first tgfb-related actors identified in vertebrate embryos (rebagliati et al., 985; weeks and melton, 1987). the localization of xvg1 to he vegetal pole of xenopus oocytes and embryos (dale et l., 1989; tannahill and melton, 1989) demonstrated an ssociation with the inducing properties of vegetal blasomeres (nieuwkoop, 1969). this expression pattern sugests a role for xvg1 in inducing and patterning embryonic ndoderm and mesoderm (vize and thomsen, 1994). proeolytic processing of xvg1 into its active form is tightly egulated (dale et al., 1989; tannahill and melton, 1989), ut mature xvg1 protein, produced using chimeric contructs, is a potent mesendodermal inducer (dale et al., 993; thomsen and melton, 1993; kessler and melton, 995; henry et al., 1996; kessler, 1999). more recently, rocessed xvg1 has been shown to influence l/r patterning f the heart and viscera in xenopus (hyatt et al., 1996; hyatt and yost, 1998). orthologs of xvg1 have been isolated from zebrafish copyright © 2000 by academic press. all right (zvg1) and chick (cvg1) using degenerate pcr and lowstringency hybridization (helde and grunwald, 1993; seleiro et al., 1996; shah et al., 1997). like xvg1, zvg1 and cvg1 are initially expressed before gastrulation, are posttranslationally regulated, and when processed to form mature protein are potent mesoderm inducers (helde and grunwald, 1993; dohrmann et al., 1996; seleiro et al., 1996; shah et al., 1997). while expression of xvg1 and zvg1 declines at the end of gastrulation, cvg1 expression is detected at later stages in paraxial mesoderm, neural tissues, and branchial arches (seleiro et al., 1996; shah et al., 1997). two mouse genes, vgr1 and vgr2/gdf3, have been named to indicate their vg1-relatedness (lyons et al., 1989a; jones et al., 1992; mcpherron and lee, 1993). despite the relation this nomenclature implies, the degree of sequence similarity, the expression patterns, and the biochemical and functional features of vgr1 and vgr2/gdf3 suggest that these are not orthologs of xvg1 (lyons et al., 1989b; jones et al., 1992; mcpherron and lee, 1993; massague et al., 1994; wall and hogan, 1994). sequence-based screening has been attempted by ourselves and others to identify a mouse vg1 ortholog, but no candidate has been isolated with the high degree of sequence similarity found for zvg1 and cvg1. mammalian vg1-related genes are potential candidates for regulating the early steps of gastrulation and l/r patterning perturbed in tgfb receptor and smad mutants. to isolate mammalian vg1-related genes an expression library was screened with a vg1 antibody and a single clone, encoding mouse gdf1, was identified (lee, 1990). sequence analysis shows that gdf1 shares higher homology with xvg1, zvg1, and cvg1 than with other tgfb proteins. we show that gdf1 expression in mouse embryos is similar to cvg1 expression in the chick. furthermore, the posttranslational processing and inducing activities of gdf1 mimic that of xvg1 in xenopus assays. finally, we demonstrate that mature gdf1 can reverse l/r pattern in the xenopus embryo, concordant with the recent loss-of-function analysis for gdf1 in the mouse (rankin et al., 2000). therefore, gdf1 is an important activator of tgfb signaling in the mouse embryo and, either alone or in combination with other tgfb ligands, regulates formation of the embryonic ody axes. materials and methods western blot analysis. in vitro translated protein was prepared using the tnt-coupled transcription–translation system (promega). templates were psp64ten-xvg1, psp64ten-zvg1 (dohrmann et al., 1996), psp64ten-cvg1 (shah et al., 1997), psp64tactivin bb (sokol et al., 1991), and pcs2-gdf1 (this work). for enopus extracts, embryos were lysed in 0.1 m tris–hcl (ph 6.8) upplemented with protease inhibitors (10 ml per embryo), the extract was cleared by centrifugation, and half an embryo was loaded per well for western analysis. for mouse extracts, embryos were lysed in 13 sample buffer (2.5 ml per embryo for 7.5 days s of reproduction in any form reserved.

sasai et al., 1996; zhang et al., 1998; agius et al., 2000). xenopus embryo culture and microinjection. xenopus embryos and animal pole explants were collected, fertilized, injected, and cultured as previously described (yao and kessler, 1999), and embryonic stages were determined according to nieuwkoop and faber . ventral blastomeres were identified at the four-cell stage by pigmentation (klein, 1987). for right-sided injection, the right side of the embryo was identified at the four-cell stage relative to dorsal–ventral pigmentation differences and a single right blastomere was injected adjacent to the second cleavage plane. capped, in vitro transcribed rna was synthesized using the message machine kit (ambion). templates for in vitro transcription were psp64ten-xvg1 (dohrmann et al., 1996), psp64t3-bmp2–vg1 (thomsen and melton, 1993), pcs2-xnr1 (sampath et al., 1997), pcs2-cerberus-short (piccolo et al., 1999), psp64t-d1xar1 (hemmati-brivanlou and melton, 1992), pcs2-mt-sid (chen et al., 1997), pcs2-gdf1, and pcs2-bmp2–gdf1 (this work). copyright © 2000 by academic press. all right results gdf1 is antigenically related to xvg1 the synthesis and posttranslational regulation of xvg1 have been analyzed using several monoclonal antisera specific for the mature domain of xvg1 (dale et al., 1989; tannahill and melton, 1989). to determine if the vg1 orthologs have antigenic relatedness in addition to sequence similarity, in vitro translated xvg1, zvg1, and cvg1 were analyzed by western blotting with the 4f6 vg1 antiserum and each protein was recognized (a). consistent with previous analysis of zvg1 and cvg1 (dohrmann et al., 1996; seleiro et al., 1996; shah et al., 1997), this result indicates that a conserved epitope is present within the mature domain of the vg1 orthologs. despite similar inducing activities (smith et al., 1990; thomsen et al., 1990), activinbb did not cross-react with the vg1 antiserum (fig. a). in addition, other tgfb-related proteins, including mp2, bmp4, and xnr1, were not recognized (data not hown). therefore, the vg1 antiserum detects a specific pitope present in the xenopus, zebrafish, and chick vg1 roteins, but not found in a number of other tgfb-related proteins. this result offered a distinct strategy for identifying mouse vg1-related genes based on antigenic relatedness. extracts of mouse embryos were analyzed by western blotting to determine the presence of mouse proteins that . the vg1 orthologs are antigenically related and mouse embryos express a vg1-cross-reactive protein.

shah et al., 1997). these results are onsistent with the recent analysis by rankin et al. . regulation of gdf1 processing tgfb-related proteins are synthesized as preproproteins hat undergo maturation by endoproteolytic cleavage, reeasing the c-terminal region as active mature protein gentry et al., 1988). while many members of the tgfb superfamily, such as activinbb, are constitutively processed, proteolysis is an important step in the posttranslational regulation of a subset of tgfb-related proteins, including vg1, nodal, and bmps (sha et al., 1989; cui et al., 1998; constam and robertson, 1999). in xenopus, xvg1 is present as an abundant precursor protein, but no processed, mature protein is detectable (dale et al., 1989; tannahill and melton, 1989). similarly, endogenous zvg1 and cvg1 accumulate as unprocessed precursors (dohrmann et al., 1996; seleiro et al., 1996; shah et al., 1997), suggesting that regulation of vg1 processing is a conserved mechanism to temporally or spatially limit production of active vg1. to determine whether proteolytic cleavage of gdf1 is regulated, gdf1 was expressed in xenopus embryos. at the one-cell stage embryos were injected with gdf1 mrna and extracts were analyzed by western blotting at the gastrula stage. gdf1 precursor was detected as an abundant 44-kda protein and, like xvg1, mature protein was not detected (a, lanes 1 and 3). this result suggests that processing of gdf1 is regulated, consistent with the detection of a precursor-sized protein, but no mature protein, in mouse embryo extracts (b). chimeric proteins containing the bmp2 or activinbb prodomain fused to the mature domain of xvg1 have been used to overcome the regulation of processing and facilitate the functional analysis of mature vg1 (a, lane 2) (dale et al., 1993; thomsen and melton, 1993; kessler and melton, 1995). in an attempt to generate mature gdf1 protein, the signal sequence, prodomain, and cleavage site of bmp2 were fused to the mature domain of gdf1 (bmp2– gdf1). bmp2–gdf1 was expressed in xenopus embryos and both precursor (46 kda) and mature protein were detected (18 kda) (a, lane 4). therefore, efficient processing of gdf1 can be accomplished by substituting s of reproduction in any form reserved. 500 wall et al. copyright © 2000 by academic press. all rights of reproduction in any form reserved. n s g e f 2 a e o i m g p m a 1 g d b 1 h s t s f 2 s u w i i m v 501induction and patterning by gdf1 the n-terminal sequences of gdf1 with those of bmp2, consistent with a proposed role for the prodomain in regulating tgfb processing (gray and mason, 1990;

sampath et al., 1997), was examined by in situ hybridization. right-sided expression of bmp2–gdf1 resulted in altered xnr1 expression in 71% of injected embryos (n 5 28), with 46% expressing xnr1 bilaterally, 7% in the right lateral plate mesoderm, and 18% lacking xnr1 expression on the left and right (figs. 8j and 8k). right-sided expression of bmp2–vg1 also altered xnr1 expression with 85% of injected embryos (n 5 13) expressng xnr1 bilaterally (d and 8e). in contrast, xnr1 expression in uninjected and native gdf1-injected embryos was normal in nearly every case (93%, n 5 14;

hyatt and yost, 1998), but differences in the stage and site of injection may account for the distinct results. therefore, right-sided expression of mature gdf1 can alter laterality in xenopus, consistent with loss-of-function analysis in the mouse demonstrating that gdf1 is essential for normal l/r patterning . reversal of left–right patterning by mature gdf1. a single d–f), gdf1 (g–i), or bmp2–gdf1 (j–l) or was not injected (a–c, lateral plate mesoderm was examined by in situ hybridization (a, views of single embryos are presented. at the late tadpole stage (st (c, f, i, l);

whitman, 1998). here we report the identification and functional analysis of gdf1, a mouse protein antigenically related to xvg1. while protein sequence comparisons of gdf1 and xvg1 argue against gene orthology, we describe regulatory and functional similarities that suggest functional homology for gdf1 and xvg1. like the vg1 orthologs, gdf1 is broadly expressed in the early embryo, gdf1 is regulated at the posttranslational level, and following maturation, gdf1 signals via smad2 to induce mesendodermal fates and alter l/r pattern. in light t blastomere was injected at the four-cell with 100 pg of bmp2–vg1 rol). at the early tailbud stage (stage 23–24) expression of xnr1 in e, g, h, j, k). left lateral (a, d, g, j) and right lateral (b, e, h, k) 5) the direction of intestinal looping was examined. ventral view ews) or 400 mm (ventral views). righ cont b, d, age 4 of our gain-of-function results in xenopus and recent gdf1 s of reproduction in any form reserved. m t r l p o o o i d a t a u i u p t t c “ d r m 1 i r a 1 s m 1 y a 1 i t m a p t r g m f i t c r t b r d n a ( t m r f f m a l 504 wall et al. loss-of-function analysis in the mouse (rankin et al., 2000), we discuss the role of gdf1 in embryonic patterning and the potential significance of the gdf1–vg1 relationship. vertebrate embryos display bilateral symmetry externally, but the internal organs, including the heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, and intestines, show l/r asymmetry in structure and/or position. the l/r axis is established early during embryogenesis and asymmetric gene expression is first detected within or adjacent to the node (burdine and schier, 2000; capdevila et al., 2000). in the chick, asymetric expression of sonic hedgehog within the node leads o perinodal expression of nodal on the left (levin et al., 1995; pagan-westphal and tabin, 1998). this local expression of nodal maintains caronte expression on the left and this cerberus-related bmp-inhibitor (rodriguez esteban et al., 1999; yokouchi et al., 1999) induces a broad nodal expression domain in the left lateral plate mesoderm, a feature common to all vertebrates (collignon et al., 1996; lowe et al., 1996; lohr et al., 1997; sampath et al., 1997; ebagliati et al., 1998). lateral nodal expression induces eft-sided expression of pitx2 in the heart, gut, and stomach rimordia, resulting in asymmetric morphogenesis of these rgans (logan et al., 1998; piedra et al., 1998; ryan et al., 1998; yoshioka et al., 1998; campione et al., 1999; kitamura et al., 1999; lin et al., 1999). the left-sided signals are negatively regulated by the tgfb-related proteins lefty1, which prevents caronte from acting across the midline, and lefty2, which competes with nodal for receptor binding (meno et al., 1996, 1998, 1999; ishimaru et al., 2000). components of this highly conserved regulatory network f asymmetric gene expression have been studied by gainf-function in the chick and xenopus, and loss-of-function n the mouse, and altered expression of each of the genes iscussed above perturbs l/r pattern. in the mouse, the l/r xis is defined as the a/p and d/v axes are established, but he embryo appears bilaterally symmetrical for several dditional days (beddington and robertson, 1999). the pstream events that break bilateral symmetry and result n asymmetric gene expression at the node are not well nderstood. in the mouse node a single monocilium rojects from each cell and the concerted movement of hese cilia generates a leftward flow of extracellular fluid. his may result in the asymmetric distribution of a sereted factor that regulates l/r polarity. supporting this nodal flow” hypothesis, mutations in specific kinesin and ynein genes disrupt nodal cilia formation and function and esult in l/r defects (supp et al., 1997; nonaka et al., 1998; arszalek et al., 1999; supp et al., 1999; takeda et al., 999; wagner and yost, 2000). in addition, an activin type i receptor, actriib, is expressed within the node and is equired for normal l/r patterning, suggesting that an ctivin-like signal generates node asymmetry (oh and li, 997). consistent with the involvement of activin-like ignals, l/r patterning defects were observed in chimeric ice with smad2-deficient embryonic tissues (heyer et al., 999). however, the identity of the activin-like ligand is et to be determined given the absence of l/r defects in r copyright © 2000 by academic press. all right ctivinba/activinbb mutant mice (matzuk et al., 995a,b). in light of the “nodal flow” model and the potential nvolvement of an activin-like signal in breaking symmery, mouse gdf1 is a candidate for an early signal in l/r patterning. moreover, gdf12/2 mice display a variety of l/r patterning defects, including situs inversus of the visceral organs, pulmonary isomersim, and cardiac defects (rankin et al., 2000). in addition, left-sided expression of nodal, lefty1, lefty2, and pitx2 was absent in gdf12/2 embryos. this loss of left-sided gene expression, as opposed to right-sided or bilateral expression observed in other l/r mutants, suggests that gdf1 acts upstream of the asymmetric genes and may play a role in establishing the l/r axis. unlike other tgfb factors involved in l/r patterning, gdf1 rna is expressed symmetrically with respect to the l/r xis at all stages. gdf1 is expressed throughout the embryo roper during gastrulation and is later enriched in cells of he node. significantly, gdf1 is expressed by node cells during the period of nodal flow and prior to the onset of asymmetric gene expression and therefore, gdf1 is present at the appropriate place and time to influence l/r axis formation. furthermore, our results demonstrate that gdf1 has activin-like signaling properties. we have shown that mature gdf1 is a potent inducer of mesendoderm and axis formation and this activity is blocked by the fast1 smad2-interaction domain, demonstrating that gdf1 signals via smad2. in addition, gdf1 is inhibited by a truncated activin type ii receptor, consistent with the involvement of the closely related receptor, actriib, in l/r patterning of the mouse. finally, right-sided expression of mature gdf1 in xenopus results in xnr1 expression on the ight and reversal of intestinal and heart looping. therefore, df1 is both necessary and sufficient for l/r patterning and ay provide the proposed activin-like function that coners l/r asymmetry on the node. the symmetrical expression of gdf1 mrna raises an ntriguing question: how does a uniformly distributed facor confer asymmetric pattern? regulation by translational ontrol, proteolytic processing, or protein stability could esult in asymmetric expression or activity of gdf1 proein. the absence of mature gdf1 protein in mouse emryos and xenopus embryos overexpressing gdf1 could esult from tight regulation of proteolytic cleavage or rapid egradation of mature protein once produced. for bmp4 and odal, the cleavage site sequence and the presence of lternative cleavage sites determines cleavage efficiency cui et al., 1998; constam and robertson, 1999). in addiion, stability of mature nodal protein is effected by prodoain sequences of the nodal precursor (constam and obertson, 1999). although unresolved at this point, we avor control of gdf1 cleavage as a regulatory mechanism or the following reasons. if gdf1 was processed and the ature domain rapidly degraded, the prodomain might ccumulate as a product of precursor cleavage. metabolic abeling of xenopus oocytes expressing native gdf1 did not eveal the accumulation of the prodomain (data not shown). s of reproduction in any form reserved. 1 t ( r s i p i t a e r o x x d r r o b b 505induction and patterning by gdf1 furthermore, despite the instability of mature nodal, native nodal does induce mesoderm in xenopus, so mature protein must accumulate to levels sufficient for biological response (jones et al., 1995). we observed no response to native gdf1 even at high expression levels (data not shown), suggesting regulation of gdf1 processing rather than stability. consistent with regulation of gdf1 cleavage in l/r patterning, loss-of-function analyses for two enzymes that cleave tgfb precursors, the proprotein convertases spc1/furin and spc4/pace4, result in l/r defects, although these proteins may regulate several tgfb proteins, including nodal and gdf1 (roebroek et al., 1998; constam and robertson, 2000a,b). on the other hand, if gdf1 is constitutively processed and stable, other mechanisms could generate asymmetric gdf1 activity. given that gdf1 mrna is uniformly expressed during the period of nodal flow, the leftward flow of extracellular fluid could result in asymmetrical accumulation of mature gdf1 on the left side of the node and lead to asymmetrical gene expression. alternatively, asymmetric expression of a gdf1 inhibitor could produce an asymmetry of gdf1 activity. we identified gdf1 based on antigenic relatedness to xvg1, and the analysis of gdf1 function and regulation has revealed several similarities to xvg1 including: pregastrula expression; sequence conservation of the mature domain and the putative receptor binding loop; regulation of proteolytic cleavage; mesendoderm and axis induction; and l/r axis reversal. previous analyses of vg1 in xenopus, zebrafish, and chick have suggested a number of potential functions in vertebrate development. gain-of-function experiments have suggested a role for vg1 in nieuwkoop center formation and/or induction of mesendoderm (dale et al., 1993; thomsen and melton, 1993; schulte-merker et al., 1994; kessler and melton, 1995; cui et al., 1996; dohrmann et al., 1996; henry et al., 1996; seleiro et al., 1996; shah et al., 1997; kessler, 1999). a role for xvg1 in mesendoderm formation is supported by studies using dominant inhibitory mutants of xvg1 and downstream signaling components (kessler and melton, 1995; henry et al., 1996; henry and melton, 1998; joseph and melton, 1998; hoodless et al., 1999; kessler, 1999). in particular, xenopus mesendoderm formation can be inhibited by a dominant negative form of xvg1 that blocks the activity of xvg1, but not other tgfb ligands (joseph and melton, 998). analyses of vegt, a maternally expressed xenopus -box gene (zhang et al., 1998), and nodal-related genes schier and shen, 2000) have established these genes as egulators of mesendodermal development, raising the posibility that xvg1 cooperates with vegt and/or nodal to nitiate mesendoderm formation. a role for xvg1 in establishing the l/r axis has also been roposed (hyatt et al., 1996; hyatt and yost, 1998), and this s noteworthy given the involvement of gdf1 in l/r paterning and the similarities between gdf1 and xvg1. yost nd colleagues have proposed a model, based on ectopic xpression of chimeric xvg1 and a truncated activin type ii copyright © 2000 by academic press. all right eceptor, in which maternal xvg1 is selectively processed n the left to generate l/r asymmetry. however, mature vg1 has not been detected in left blastomeres of the enopus embryo; mature xvg1 stimulates a smad2ependent signal identical to that produced by nodalelated proteins such as xnr1; and the truncated activin eceptor used to inhibit endogenous xvg1 also inhibits ther tgfb-related ligands, including xnr1. for these reasons, it is possible that mature xvg1 phenocopies the activity of xnr1 or other tgfb ligands. for example, the right-sided injection of activin protein was shown to mimic nodal activity and reverse l/r patterning (toyoizumi et al., 2000). alternatively, given the similarities of xvg1 and gdf1, xvg1 may phenocopy an, as yet unidentified, xenopus gdf1 activity that acts upstream of xnr1. it should be noted, however, that our studies do not distinguish between a specific activity of mature gdf1 and an ability to phenocopy xnr1 activity. analysis of the vg1 orthologs has demonstrated a conservation of expression pattern, posttranslational regulation, and inducing activity, suggesting a conservation of vg1 function as well. in addition, the successful isolation of vg1 orthologs from the zebrafish and chick argues for the existence of a mouse ortholog. a number of reasons may account for the difficulty in identifying mouse vg1, including very low mrna abundance or unexpectedly high sequence divergence. the attempt to identify mouse vg1 resulted in the identification of gdf1, a gene with striking sequence, regulatory, and functional similarity to the vg1 orthologs, and our analysis of gdf1 points to an important role in establishing the l/r axis. although not a mammalian vg1 ortholog, gdf1 may be a functional homolog of vg1 that regulates development of the early mouse embryo. further efforts will be required to identify the elusive mouse vg1 gene and determine the role of vg1-related genes in vertebrate development. acknowledgments we are grateful to beth destasio, mark engleka, and peter klein for constructive comments on the manuscript. we thank ruth foreman and valerie cluzet for assistance with the mouse in situ experiments. we thank eddy de robertis, stephano piccolo, malcolm whitman, and chris wright for providing plasmids. this work was supported by grants from the nih (hd35159), the american digestive health foundation, the pew scholars program, and the american heart association. references agius, e., oelgeschlager, m., wessely, o., kemp, c., and de robertis, e. m. . endodermal nodal-related signals and mesoderm induction in xenopus. development 127, 1173–1183. eddington, r. s., and robertson, e. j. . axis development and early asymmetry in mammals. cell 96, 195–209. eppu, h., kawabata, m., hamamoto, t., chytil, a., minowa, o., noda, t., and miyazono, k. . bmp type ii receptor is s of reproduction in any form reserved. b c c c c c c d d d g g h h h h 506 wall et al. required for gastrulation and early development of mouse embryos. dev. biol. 221, 249–258. bourbon, h. m., lapeyre, b., and amalric, f. . structure of the mouse nucleolin gene: the complete sequence reveals that each rna binding domain is encoded by two independent exons. j. mol. biol. 200, 627–638. urdine, r. d., and schier, a. f. . conserved and divergent mechanisms in left–right axis formation. genes dev. 14, 763– 776. campione, m., steinbeisser, h., schweickert, a., deissler, k., van bebber, f., lowe, l. a., nowotschin, s., viebahn, c., haffter, p., kuehn, m. r., and blum, m. . the homeobox gene pitx2: mediator of asymmetric left–right signaling in vertebrate heart and gut looping. development 126, 1225–1234. capdevila, j., vogan, k. j., tabin, c. j., and izpisua belmonte, j. c. . mechanisms of left–right determination in vertebrates. cell 101, 9–21. chang, h., zwijsen, a., vogel, h., huylebroeck, d., and matzuk, m. m. . smad5 is essential for left–right asymmetry in mice. dev. biol. 219, 71–78. chen, x., weisberg, e., fridmacher, v., watanabe, m., naco, g., and whitman, m. . smad4 and fast-1 in the assembly of activin-responsive factor. nature 389, 85–89. collignon, j., varlet, i., and robertson, e. j. . relationship between asymmetric nodal expression and the direction of embryonic turning. nature 381, 155–158. conlon, f. l., lyons, k. m., takaesu, n., barth, k. s., kispert, a., herrmann, b., and robertson, e. j. . a primary requirement for nodal in the formation and maintenance of the primitive streak in the mouse. development 120, 1919–1928. onlon, f., and beddington, r. . mouse gastrulation from a frog’s prospective. semin. dev. biol. 6, 249–256. onstam, d. b., and robertson, e. j. . regulation of bone morphogenetic protein activity by pro domains and proprotein convertases. j. cell biol. 144, 139–149. onstam, d. b., and robertson, e. j.

immunoglobulins have long been known to increase with age in c57bl/6 mice10. we also show that circulating gdf11/8 levels decrease with age in mice as well as other mammalian species and that increasing gdf11/8 levels with exogenous gdf11 regulates cardiomyocyte size. in addition, new data from large human cohorts show that gdf11/8 declines with age, and low gdf11/8 levels are associated with an increased risk of pathological cardiovascular events and death11. these data suggest that the age-dependent decline in circulating gdf11/8 levels in mammals may have clinical relevance. at central michigan university on october 21, 2015 from  doi: 10.1161/circresaha.115.307521 4 methods animal care and usage. all animal studies were performed as approved by the harvard committee on animals. aged (22 months old) c57bl/6 mice and serum from 4 months old and 18 months old rats were obtained from the national institute on aging (nia). rag1 ko male retired breeders (7 months old) and age/sex-matched wild type retired breeders were obtained from jackson laboratories (rag 1ko: 002216; wt: 000664). serum from horses and sheep was obtained from biochemed services, va. western analysis. serum and protein samples for figures 2 and 3 were prepared with loading buffer containing tris-hcl (50 mmol/l; ph 6.8), dtt (100 mmol/l), β-mercaptoethanol (4%), sds (2%), bromophenol blue (0.1%) and glycerol (10%). heart tissues (figure 4) were lysed in ripa buffer (25 mmol/l tris-hcl ph 7.6, 150 mmol/l nacl, 1% np-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sds) freshly supplemented with 1 mmol/l pmsf (sigma-aldrich), proteinase inhibitor (sigma), protein phosphatase inhibitor 2 and 3 (sigmaaldrich) and supplemented with 1.25% β-mercaptoethanol (sigma-aldrich). all samples were boiled 5 min at 95°c, loaded on nupage 4-12% bis-tris gels (lifetechnologies) and run with nupage mes sds running buffer (lifetechnologies) supplemented with sodium metabisulfite (5 mmol/l). proteins were then transferred on polyvinylidene fluoride (perkinelmer life sciences) or nitrocellulose (amersham protran, ge healthcare) membranes in transfer buffer containing 10 mmol/l tris-hcl, 200 mmol/l glycine and 20% methanol. following transfer, membranes were incubated with blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk in 10 mmol/l tris-hcl ph 7.5, 0.5 mol/l nacl and 0.1% tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and successively with primary antibodies at 4°c overnight. proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham™ ge healthcare, rpn2236). for coomassie staining, gels were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with fixing solution (25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% glacial acetic acid) and incubated overnight with pageblue protein staining solution (lifetechnologies). igg depletion from mouse serum. 400 μl of old mouse serum was diluted 2-fold in modified pbs buffer containing 0.6 mol/l nacl and 0.02% np-40. igg was depleted from mouse serum by sepharose-protein g absorption. diluted serum was incubated three times with 300 μl of protein g sepharose fast flow (ge healthcare) for 1.5 h at room temperature. 200 μl of the protein g-depleted serum was then incubated twice with 45 μg of anti-mouse igg rabbit monoclonal antibody (ab190475, abcam) coupled to 30 μl of protein g sepharose for 1.5 h to further remove residual igg from the protein g-depleted serum. igg captured by protein g sepharose was washed extensively with modified pbs and eluted by 0.1 mol/l glycine, ph 2.8. eluted igg fractions were neutralized by adding 1/30 of a volume of 2 mol/l tris-hcl, ph 7.5. primary antibodies. anti-psmad2 , anti-psmad3 , anti-totsmad (43b4) and anti-gapdh are from cell signaling; anti-gdf11/8 (ab124721) and anti-cardiac troponin t antibody (ab8295) are from abcam; anti-psmad3 from millipore (07-1389) was used for immunostaining. secondary antibodies: goat antirabbit igg (h+l)-hrp conjugate, bio-rad 172-1019;

applied biosystems) after zip-tip clean up (millipore) and the other half was submitted for lc-ms/ms analysis on the ltq orbitrap xt mass spectrometer (thermo fisher scientific). data from both mass spectrometry platforms were searched using matrix science mascot search program against updated non-redundant database from ncbi. immunofluorescence and histology. for paraffin sections (figure 5c), mouse hearts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded. upon deparaffinization and rehydration, samples were pretreated with boiling sodium citrate (10 mmol/l; ph 7.2) for 30 min, followed by incubation with primary antibodies at 21°c for 2 h and then alexa fluor–conjugated secondary antibodies (molecular probes, invitrogen). for cryo-sections (figure 6b), mouse hearts were rinsed in 1x pbs, and embedded in optimum cutting temperature (oct) compound and frozen. seven μm sections were air-dried and further processed through 4% pfa and 0.5% triton x-100. blocking and incubation of primary and secondary antibodies were processed in 1% normal goat serum in 1x pbs. after counterstaining with dapi, sections were mounted and observed under fluorescence microscopy. all quantitative analyses were performed in a blinded manner. all images were post-processed in imagej (nih) software. gene expression analysis. spleen, kidney and quadriceps muscle were harvested from young (2 mo) and old (24 mo) c57bl/6 mice and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. total rna was extracted with trizol (life technologies), and equal amounts of rna were reverse transcribed to generate cdna (superscript iii first strand synthesis supermix for qrt-pcr, life technologies). real time pcr analysis was performed on an applied biosystems 7900ht real time pcr system using taqman primers for gdf11 (mm01159973_m1, taqman gene expression assays, life technologies). relative quantification was calculated with the δδct method using hprt (mm01545399_m1, taqman gene expression assay, life technologies) as a reference gene. statistical analysis. statistical comparison was performed by unpaired t-test, analysis of variance or mann-whitney analysis for gene expression analysis. statistical analysis was carried out with the graphpad prism 6 software and statistical significance was assigned to differences with a p value < 0.05. at central michigan university on october 21, 2015 from  doi: 10.1161/circresaha.115.307521 6 results age-dependent decrease of gdf11/8 levels across multiple species. as gdf11 and gdf8 are highly homologous, they are difficult to distinguish biochemically and by most commercial antibodies, including the monoclonal abcam antibody against gdf11 used by us7, 12 and, also by egerman et al. and smith et al. (8, 9 and data not shown). thus, as in egerman et al., we refer to the proteins recognized by this antibody as gdf11/8 unless otherwise noted. to examine age dependent variations in gdf11/8 levels, we compared circulating gdf11/8 protein levels across four different mammalian species at various ages using western analysis (figure 2a-d). western analysis under reducing conditions revealed that the ~12.5 kda band corresponding to the reduced monomer of gdf11/8, decreased dramatically with age in serum from mice (figure 2a), rats (figure 2b), horses (figure 2c) and sheep (figure 2d). we also identified the ~25 kda band described by egerman et al.8, which showed an agedependent increase in all four species analyzed. in order to corroborate the results obtained in serum, we also examined gdf11 gene expression changes as a function of age in multiple mouse tissues (figure 2e). old mice showed significant reduction in gdf11 gene expression in spleen and kidney by quantitative rt-pcr analysis compared to young mice, but no differences were observed in skeletal muscle tissue (n=6-9 mice). studies by other groups have similarly reported equivalent abundance of gdf11 mrna found in skeletal muscle in young vs aged mice, rats and humans2. the key 25 kda protein recognized by anti-gdf11 antibodies increases with age in serum and, as shown here, is predominantly serum igg light chain. egerman et al.8 claimed that the ~25 kda band identified by the anti-gdf11 abcam antibody used in their studies, and ours, corresponds to the dimeric and active form of gdf11/8. based on this statement, they argued that serum gdf11 levels increase overall with age, in contradiction with our previous reports7, 12. a close inspection of the coomassie loading gel in the egerman study (figure 1c of egerman et al.8) strongly suggested that the ~25 kda band represents a high abundance ~25 kda protein in serum and not gdf11, as their coomassie loading control shows a clear correlation with their western analysis at ~25 kda. because this ~25 kda protein appeared to be very abundant in serum and failed to migrate at ~12.5 kda under reducing conditions, we hypothesized that this band was not gdf11/8 but represented immunoglobulin light chain. immunoglobulin light chain has a molecular weight of ~25 kda, and it has long been known that plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins increase with age in mammals including mice10. indeed, western analysis demonstrated that the abcam anti-gdf11/8 antibody recognized both heavy (~50 kda) and light (~25 kda) chains of purified mouse igg (figure 3a-b) and also purified rat, sheep and horse igg (online figure i and ii). we also found that the ~25 kda light chain band co-migrated with the band identified as the gdf11 dimer by egerman and colleagues in the serum of old mice and old rats8. to further corroborate the conclusion that egerman et al.8 quantitated igg light chain as gdf11, we performed western analysis using the same gdf11/8 antibody on sera from mice deficient in recombinase activating gene 1 (rag1 ko), which are genetically incapable of producing immunoglobulin. as shown in figure 3c, the ~25 kda band was absent in rag1 ko mice compared to wild type mice, further suggesting that the ~25 kda band was indeed immunoglobulin light chain. in order to investigate whether the ~12.5 kda band could also correspond to igg, we performed igg depletion from serum pooled from three old mice (figure 4a, online figure iii) or three young mice (figure 4b) using protein-g sepharose resin followed by further immunodepletion with a monoclonal anti-mouse igg antibody. protein g and the anti-mouse igg antibody bind specifically to igg. removal of igg from old mouse serum nearly eliminated detection of the band at ~25 kda, showing that this band is primarily composed of serum igg light chain at central michigan university on october 21, 2015 from  doi: 10.1161/circresaha.115.307521 7 and not gdf11/8. the ~25 kda band was recovered upon elution of igg captured by protein g-sepharose (figure 4a, online figure iii). importantly, igg depletion from young mouse serum showed similar results with depletion of the ~25 kda band and the ~12.5 kda band remaining unchanged (figure 4b). we also performed mass spectrometry analysis on serum samples pooled from three old mice to identify protein abundance in the ~25 kda region. as expected, the majority of proteins identified within the ~25 kda band corresponded to immunoglobulin light chain (figure 4c-d). collectively, our results unequivocally demonstrate that the ~25 kda band measured by egerman et al. as gdf11 corresponds to igg light chain and increases with age, while the ~12.5 kda band decreases with age. gdf11 activates smad signaling in cardiomyocytes. gdf11 and gdf8 appear to activate the same receptors2, 13, 14. the pro-domain of gdf11 can inhibit its mature ligand function, while direct administration of mature functional gdf11 can activate downstream signaling, leading to phosphorylation of smad2. exogenous gdf11 is expected to activate smad2 phosphorylation irrespective of whether the endogenous circulating protein is gdf11, gdf8, or both. to test the effects of gdf11 administration on intracellular signaling in vivo, we treated young and old mice with a single dose (1 mg/kg) of recombinant gdf11 via intravenous injection. as expected, smad2 phosphorylation was observed in the myocardium of young mice (figure 5a-b) with nuclear localization of phospho-smad3 in both cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes (figure 5c; the patchiness observed in lower magnification is a fixation artifact) one-hour after gdf11 injection. aged mice showed higher basal levels of phosphorylated smad2, supporting previous studies suggesting that aged cells have reduced sensitivity to exogenous tgf-β due to constitutively active tgf-β signaling and to the increased presence of other tgf-β ligands15, 16. gdf11 administration reduces heart mass in old and young mice. we previously reported that administration of gdf11 at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 28 consecutive days reduced cardiac hypertrophy in old mice7. to further characterize the anti-hypertrophic effect of gdf11, we performed a dose titration study in young and aged mice and observed a significant dose-dependent decrease of heart weight, normalized to tibia length, after only nine days of treatment in mice receiving 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day gdf11 (figure 6a). histological analysis of cardiac tissue (figure 6b) revealed that gdf11 administration at 1.0 mg/kg/day for nine days reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area in young and old mice. moreover, we observed that gdf11 significantly reduces body weight in young mice (1.0 mg/kg/day) and old mice (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day) (online table i). these results reveal that increasing circulating gdf11/8 levels with exogenous gdf11 can regulate cardiac hypertrophy in both young and old mice. however, reductions in body weight suggest that in addition to direct signaling to the heart by exogenous gdf11, secondary signals from adipose tissue or other mechanisms may play a role in the antihypertrophic effect. at central michigan university on october 21, 2015 from  doi: 10.1161/circresaha.115.307521 8 discussion in the present study, we show that circulating gdf11/8 levels decline with age in multiple mammalian species, including mouse. despite generating and testing dozens of custom monoclonal antibodies and commercial elisa kits, we have been unable to identify precisely whether the decline is due to changes in gdf11, gdf8 or a combination of both. similarly, an aptamer used in prior studies that recognizes an epitope of gdf11 also recognizes gdf88, but this aptamer against gdf11/8 also shows declining blood levels in humans with age11. gdf11 and gdf8 are both processed to active mature ligands that are ~25kda in total mass, but in reducing conditions, the active mature ligand is reduced to ~12.5 kda (figure 1). here we demonstrate that the ~25 kda band reported to increase with age in mouse serum and claimed to be the gdf11 dimer, as suggested by figure 1 in the prior publication by egerman et al.8, is actually igg light chain. our experiments revealed the affinity of the anti-gdf11/8 abcam antibody for igg light chain, as the signal dramatically diminished upon igg depletion. in order to corroborate this result, we performed mass spectrometry analysis and confirmed that igg light chain is the predominant component of the ~25 kda band (figure 4). comparison of the ~25 kda band in old and young animals is consistent with the previously reported age-dependent increase in serum immunoglobulins10, and thus it is not surprising that egerman et al 8 confused the ~25 kda band for gdf11. given that the ~25 kda band is immunoglobulin light chain, the data of egerman et al.8 actually show that gdf11/8 levels decline with age, as their data on the ~12.5 kda band and its decline with age are essentially identical to ours. a recent report from rodgers suggested that levels of gdf11 in circulation may be too low to have physiologic relevance; however, that conclusion should be viewed with caution, as it was based on an assay that shows selective detection of gdf8 (not gdf11), as confirmed by the rodgers paper itself (rodgers et al.17, fig. 1a). moreover, prior studies applying mass spectrometry-based proteomics have confirmed the presence of gdf11 in the blood of both mice and humans18. importantly, the potential relevance of declining circulating gdf11/8 levels in animals reported here has now been demonstrated in patients with coronary disease 11. olson et al. described two large, independent cohorts of patients with stable ischemic heart disease, in whom lower levels of circulating gdf11/8 were associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events, higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and death11. furthermore, even in the relatively narrow age-range of coronary patients compared to the general population, gdf11/8 levels declined with age11. our group has described the potential role of exogenous gdf11 as an anti-hypertrophic factor. we previously demonstrated the anti-hypertrophic effect of gdf11 in mice by showing that administration of 0.1 mg/kg/day of gdf11 for 28 days reduced cardiac mass in aged mice7. however, a recent article by smith et al. did not observe similar findings using the same dose of gdf11 (0.1 mg/kg/day) over the same period of 28 days9. after our prior publication, but before this study, we became aware of batch-to batch variations in the concentration of recombinant gdf11 protein. we reported this to the manufacturer, which confirmed with their own experiments that there was indeed substantial deviation of the actual amount of gdf11 from what was indicated by the company. following correction of this variation, we confirmed that the protein concentrations in the current lots are more reliable, and thus we performed a more thorough study of dose-dependent effects of gdf11 on cardiac hypertrophy over a period of nine days. as shown in figure 6a, it appears that a minimum dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day leads to rapid reduction in cardiac mass. we speculate that differences between our initial study1 and smith et al 2 could be due to variations in commercial protein lots that occurred prior to more rigorous quality control. differences between our initial observations, the present results and the results reported by smith et al. could be explained by a combination of different protein sources, protein refolding efficiencies and concentrations employed. as gdf11 is now being studied as an in vivo pharmacological agent rather than a cell biology reagent, attention to dose response and bioactivity is clearly important, as differences in protein refolding and preparation will affect any experiment. at central michigan university on october 21, 2015 from  doi: 10.1161/circresaha.115.307521 9 it will be important to investigate the mechanisms causing the observed decrease in body weight induced by gdf11 (online table i). preliminary data from our laboratory show that administration of 0.5 mg/kg/day gdf11 for a period of 9 days induces significant reduction in adipose tissue in old mice, whereas skeletal muscle tissue mass remains unchanged (unpublished data). these data suggest a potential indirect effect of adipose tissue on cardiac tissue initiated by exogenous gdf11. thus far, it appears that circulating gdf11/8 levels in a given species and at a specific age are in a relatively narrow range. since adding gdf11 to the systemic circulation has clear effects but in a specific dose range, it is plausible that both hyperactivity and hypoactivity of this signaling system could lead to abnormal physiology. we speculate that sustained overexpression of gdf11/8 signaling could lead to adverse effects in some tissues, even if other tissues tolerate increases beyond the normal range. this scenario is common in mammalian hormonal systems, including thyroid, adrenal and pituitary hormones. in conclusion, our data show that circulating gdf11/8 levels decline with age in multiple mammalian species and that systemic administration of gdf11 protein rapidly stimulates smad signaling in the heart and reduces cardiac mass in both young and old mice. because low circulating levels of gdf11/8 also predict future mortality in coronary patients, unraveling the specific contributions of circulating gdf8 vs. gdf11 and determining how circulating levels of these ligands and their inhibitors affect myocardial biology is an important goal. potential approaches to distinguish gdf11 vs gdf8 have been taken by analyzing differences in the pro-domains 19, 20. because the pro-domains of gdf11 and gdf8 are substantially different, analyses of these pro-domains and their biological effects may yield significant differences that are not shown in studies of the mature gdf11 and gdf8 ligands. sources of funding this study was supported in part by the national institutes of health (rtl r01ag032977, r01ag040019, and r03ag049657; ajw r56 ag048917) and by the

significance what is known?  growth differentiation factor 8 (gdf8) and gdf11 share 89% amino acid identity and are secreted in a latent complex that becomes biologically active after proteolytic cleavage to a dimer consisting of two disulfide-linked ~12.5 kda carboxy-terminal monomers.  recent studies have questioned the anti-hypertrophic effects of increasing gdf11 in the circulation as well as the decline of gdf11 in the circulation with aging. what new information does this article contribute?  we show an age-dependent decline of circulating gdf11/8 in multiple species, including mouse.  daily injection of recombinant gdf11 leads to a dose-dependent reduction of cardiac mass (heart weight/tibia length ratio) and cardiomyocyte size with rapid activation of smad signaling. here we show that the previously reported increase in gdf11 dimer with age is not gdf11 but predominantly immunoglobulin light chain; immunoglobulins have long been known to increase with age in c57bl/6 mice. our data demonstrate that circulating gdf11/8 levels decrease with age in mice as well as other mammalian species and that systemic administration of gdf11 protein reduces cardiac mass in both young and old mice. overall, this study provides evidence in support of the concept of gdf11 as an age-related anti-hypertrophic hormone. at central michigan university on october 21, 2015 from  s s

conditions were prepared with loading buffer containing tris-hcl (50 mmol/l; ph 6.8), dtt (100 mmol/l), β-mercaptoethanol (4%), sds (2%) bromophenol blue (0.1%) and glycerol (10%). samples were boiled 5 min at 95°c, loaded on nupage 4-12% bis-tris gels (lifetechnologies) and run with nupage mes sds running buffer (lifetechnologies) supplemented with sodium metabisulfite (5 mmol/l). for non-reducing gel, protein samples were prepared in the same loading buffer but without βmercaptoethanol (4%), loaded on nupage 4-12% bis-tris gels (lifetechnologies) and run with nupage mes sds running buffer (lifetechnologies). after the run, the non-reducing gel was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with running buffer, dtt (40 mmol/l) and βmercaptoethanol (4%). proteins form non-reducing and reducing gels were then transferred on polyvinylidene fluoride (perkinelmer life sciences) or nitrocellulose (amersham protran, ge healthcare) membranes in transfer buffer containing 10 mmol/l tris-hcl, 200mmol/l glycine and 20% methanol. following transfer, membranes were incubated with blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk in 10 mmol/l tris-hcl ph 7.5, 0.5 mol/l nacl and 0.1% tween-20) for one hour and successively with primary antibodies over night. for figure s1 (middle panel) no primary antibody was included in the overnight incubation. proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (perkinelmer life sciences). band intensity was analyzed using imagej software. for coomassie staining, gels were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes with fixing solution (25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% glacial acetic acid) and incubated overnight with pageblue protein staining solution (lifetechnologies). purified

28, 2019; accepted june 5, 2019] abstract: the molecular processes of aging are very heterogenic and not fully understood. studies on rare progeria syndromes, which display an accelerated progression of physiological aging, can help to get a better understanding. pseudoxanthoma elasticum (pxe) caused by mutations in the atp-binding cassette sub-family c member 6 (abcc6) gene shares some molecular characteristics with such premature aging diseases. thus, this is the first study trying to broaden the knowledge of aging processes in pxe patients. in this study, we investigated aging associated biomarkers in primary human dermal fibroblasts and sera from pxe patients compared to healthy controls. determination of serum concentrations of the aging biomarkers eotaxin-1 (ccl11), growth differentiation factor 11 (gdf11) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf1) showed no significant differences between pxe patients and healthy controls. insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (igfbp3) showed a significant increase in serum concentrations of pxe patients older than 45 years compared to the appropriate control group. tissue specific gene expression of gdf11 and igfbp3 were significantly decreased in fibroblasts from pxe patients compared to normal human dermal fibroblasts (nhdf). igfbp3 protein concentration in supernatants of fibroblasts from pxe patients were decreased compared to nhdf but did not reach statistical significance due to potential gender specific variations. the minor changes in concentration of circulating aging biomarkers in sera of pxe patients and the significant aberrant tissue specific expression seen for selected factors in pxe fibroblasts, suggests a link between abcc6 deficiency and accelerated aging processes in affected peripheral tissues of pxe patients. key words: pseudoxanthoma elasticum, aging, ccl11, gdf11, igf1, igfbp aging is a heterogeneous process which is characterized by a time-dependent decline of physiological functionality and integrity. thus, as an organism ages, it gets progressively vulnerable to various pathologies like cancer, diabetes as well as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases ultimately leading to death (reviewed in ). due to the complexity of aging, finding appropriate study models is still a problem. in many cases rare progeria syndromes like the hutchinson-gilford-progeria syndrome (hgps) or related cell culture models displaying an accelerated aging process are used for gerontological studies [2-4]. as one single model cannot provide an entire description of potential physiological volume 11, number 3; xxx-xx, june 2020  mailto:   tiemann j., et al linking abcc6 deficiency to premature aging aging and disease volume 11, number 3, june 2020 2 aging processes, the need for further models is steadily of great interest. pseudoxanthoma elasticum (pxe) is a rare inherited genetic disorder caused by mutations in the atp-binding cassette subfamily c member 6 (abcc6) gene which causes a deficiency of the encoded transporter protein [5, 6]. in the general population the prevalence of pxe is supposed to be between 1:25 000 and 1:100 000. females seem to be affected more often than males for yet unknown reasons (summarized in ). thusfar, the molecular characteristics of pxe have only barely been discussed or interpreted in the light of premature aging processes although patients display clinical and molecular characteristics of premature aging and known premature aging syndromes. pxe patients display soft tissue calcification affecting the skin, eyes and the cardiovascular system. it primarily leads to the fragmentation of elastic fibers and remodeling of the extracellular matrix resulting in a premature loss of skin elasticity, extensive wrinkle formation, arteriosclerosis and visual impairment with similarities to macular degeneration, all of which are clinical characteristics of the elderly (summarized in [7, 8]). molecular studies showed that abcc6 deficiency leads to aberrant pyrophosphate homeostasis, a known calcification inhibitor, characterized by a decreased plasma concentration [9-12]. similar observations were made in patients suffering from the premature aging syndrome hgps . it was further shown that the progression of hgps can be decelerated by administration of statins and bisphosphonates . studies demonstrated that this therapy could be also beneficial for pxe although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear [1416]. additionally, it was shown that abcc6 deficiency leads to an aberrant mitochondrial function and a loss of proteostasis characterized by abnormal expression and serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases [17, 18]. both, mitochondrial dysfunction and a loss of proteostasis are known to play a role in physiological aging [19-21]. additionally, studies showed that blood from young mice have rejuvenating effects in old mice, demonstrating that specific blood factors need to change concentrations during the course of aging [22-24]. similar assumptions could be made for pxe pathogenesis as parabiosis experiments with abcc6-/-/ rag-/and wild-type mice resulted in a prevention of further ectopic mineralization in abcc6-/-/ rag-/mice . furthermore, it was shown that normal human fibroblasts form abnormal elastic fiber aggregates when cultured with serum from pxe patients . to gain insight into potential blood factors involved in pxe pathogenesis, the investigation of aging processes in pxe patients by determination of biomarkers showing clear association with aging could be helpful. changes in concentration of proteins like growth differentiation factor 11 (gdf11), eotaxin-1 (ccl11), insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf1) and its binding protein insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (igfbp3) were associated with aging processes [24, 27-30]. by analyzing these aging biomarkers in sera and fibroblasts of pxe patients, we could show aberrant mrna and protein expression in supernatants of pxe fibroblasts as well as abnormal serum concentrations of specific aging biomarkers in pxe patients underlining the suggestion of potential premature aging processes. with this, we were able to give first evidence for a link between an abcc6 deficiency and accelerated aging processes especially in affected peripheral tissues of pxe patients. material and methods experimental design the study was approved by the ethics commission of the ruhr university of bochum faculty of medicine, located in bad oeynhausen. patients participating in the study gave their written informed consent. the goal of the study was to investigate known aging biomarker in pxe sera to evaluate whether potential premature aging processes contribute to pxe pathogenesis. because little is known about aging processes of pxe patients, some of the most prominent serum proteins with clear connection to aging (ccl11, gdf11, igf1 and igfbp3) were chosen to get first insights [24, 27-30]. in case of ambiguous results or aberrant serum concentrations in pxe patients compared to controls additional mrna analysis in fibroblasts and protein determination in cell culture supernatants was performed when possible. patient characteristics in all patients the diagnosis of pxe was consistent with the consensus criteria reported . age/sex-matched blood donors served in this study as healthy controls. for analysis, each cohort was divided into subgroups composed of patients and healthy controls under 45 years and subgroups composed of patients and healthy controls over 45 years. the subgroups including patients and healthy controls under 45 years consisted of 18 female [mean ± sd age, 31.9 ± 7.86 years] and 5 male [39.6 ± 4.51 years] pxe patients as well as 18 female [32.0 ± 7.87 years] and 5 male [39.8 ± 4.60 years] blood donors as healthy controls. the subgroups including patients and healthy controls over 45 years consisted of 14 female [55.0 ± 8.20 years] and 8 male [54.6 ± 9.38 years] tiemann j., et al linking abcc6 deficiency to premature aging aging and disease volume 11, number 3, june 2020 3 pxe patients as well as 14 female [54.5 ± 6.65 years] and 8 male [53.6 ± 6.70 years] blood donors as healthy controls. cell culture normal human dermal fibroblasts (nhdf) from healthy controls were purchased from coriell institute for medical research (camden, usa). dermal fibroblasts from pxe patients were isolated from skin biopsies . a summary of fibroblast characteristics used can be additionally found in table 1. for cultivation, dulbecco’s modified essential medium (dmem, gibco, invitrogen, germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum (fcs; biowest, aidenbach, germany), 2% l-glutamine (200mm) (pan biotech, eidenach, germany) and 1% antibiotic/ antimycotic solution (paa laboratories, pasching, austria) was used. cells were subcultured as they reached confluency. for experiments cells between passage 9 and 12 were used. biological samples were performed in triplicates for all experiments. cells were seeded with a final density of 177 cells/ mm2 using 60 mm culture dishes (bd falcon) and cultivated for 24 h in 10% fcs. after this, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs; gibco, invitrogen, germany) and medium was replaced with fresh 10% fcs. medium was changed every 3-4 d and cells were cultured for 21 d. table 1. characterization of human dermal fibroblasts from pxe patients and healthy controls. sample id gender age1

aliquot was collected after the first column based cleanup step. dna isolation was performed using nucleospin blood extraction kit (macherey-nagel, düren, germany). dna concentrations were used to normalize elisa measurement data of cell culture supernatants to the number of cells during culture. gene expression analysis rna was isolated as previously described. 1 µg rna was transcribed to cdna using superscript ii reverse transcriptase (thermo fisher scientific, san diego, usa). for final measurements 2.5 µl cdna (1:10), 0.25 µl forward and reverse primer (biomers, ulm, germany), 2.0 µl water and 5.0 µl lightcycler 480 sybr green i master reaction mixture (roche, penzberg, germany) was mixed. after incubation for 5 min at 95°c, gene expression was determined by performing 45 cycles of denaturation (95°c, 10 s), annealing (specific annealing temperature, 15 s) and elongation (72°c, 20 s). thereafter melting curve analysis was done. quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) was performed using lightcycler 480 (roche, penzberg, germany) under conditions described in table 2. as igfbp3 and gdf11 showed aberrant or ambiguous serum concentrations, relative mrna expression levels were measured and normalized to relative β-actin (β-actin), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and β2-micro-globulin (β2m) mrna expression. results were calculated using deltadelta ct method considering pcr efficiency. technical triplicates were performed for each biological sample. tiemann j., et al linking abcc6 deficiency to premature aging aging and disease volume 11, number 3, june

development kit (r&d systems, abingdon, uk) was used to develop a sandwich elisa. the gdf11 elisa was basically designed as recommended by the manufacturer. gdf11 standard was set up in fcs as calibrator diluent. for background measurement of standard, the zero standard was used. to consider any interfering effects of human sera on the antibody reaction, the lowest sample value measured was taken as background measurement . for targets showing ambiguous results (gdf11) or aberrant serum concentrations in pxe patients compared to controls (igfbp3) additional mrna analysis in fibroblasts and protein determination in cell culture supernatants was performed when possible. measurements of gdf11 in cell culture supernatants failed because concentrations were below detection limit (31.3 pg/ml). statistical analysis for qpcr analysis and protein concentrations of supernatants, data are shown as means ± standard error (sem). for serum protein concentrations, data are shown as box-plot with median, 25th and 75th percentile and tukey whiskers (± 1.5 times interquartile range). graphpad prism 5.0 was used as a statistical software. data distribution was analyzed by shapiro-wilk test. for results of the measurement of serum concentrations a student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed) was performed in case of normal distribution. if one of the compared groups was not gaussian distributed the nonparametric twotailed mann-whitney u test was done. for gene expression results and protein concentrations in supernatants the nonparametric two-tailed mannwhitney u test was performed. p-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. table 2. primer sequences used for quantitative real-time pcr. gene protein 5 -́3 śequence reference1 annealing

age in pxe patients (<45 years: 135.4 ± 10.6 pg/ml; >45 years: 207.8 ± 22.9 pg/ml; p≤0.01) as well as in healthy controls (<45 years: 158.9 ± 13.0 pg/ml; >45 years: 231.7 ± 21.8 pg/ml; p≤0.01). no significant differences in ccl11 protein concentration were seen between pxe patients and healthy controls. aberrant serum concentration and decreased gene expression of gdf11 in pxe patients because of low gdf11 serum concentrations, 20% of measured values were outside standard curve and were tiemann j., et al linking abcc6 deficiency to premature aging aging and disease volume 11, number 3, june

p>0.05. cohorts <45 years (n=23) vs. cohorts >45 years (n=22): ##/++ p≤0.01. to further evaluate gdf11 levels in pxe patients, mrna expression analysis was performed. as seen in b, gdf11 mrna expression in pxe fibroblasts was significantly decreased compared to age/sex-matched nhdf (pxe: 0.53 ± 0.04; control: 0.92 ± 0.04; p≤0.001). determination of gdf11 protein concentrations in supernatants was not possible because concentrations were below the detection limit. altered protein concentration and gene expression of igf1 and igfbp3 in healthy controls, serum protein concentration of igf1 showed a minor decrease with age. this was not seen for serum concentrations of igf1 in pxe patients. however, in pxe patients under 45 years slightly lower igf1 levels compared to the appropriate healthy control group were observed. none of these results reached statistical significance (a). for igfbp3, no significant age dependent changes in serum concentrations were seen for pxe patients or for healthy controls. however, pxe patients over 45 years showed a significant increase in serum igfbp3 concentrations compared to appropriate healthy controls (pxe: 2543.0 ± 104.9 ng/ml; control: 2117.0 ± 147.6 ng/ml; p≤0.05) (b). figure 2. systemic concentration and local mrna expression of gdf11.

(a) relative igfbp3 mrna expression of pxe fibroblasts (grey) and nhdf (white). (b) igfbp3 protein concentration in supernatant of pxe fibroblasts (grey) and nhdf (white). data are shown as mean ± sem. control/pxe: p≤0.05; ns p>0.05. the first biomarker analyzed is ccl11. ccl11 is a chemokine, acting as a chemoattractant for eosinophils and plays a role in arteriosclerosis, inflammation and neurogenesis [29, 34, 35]. we found significantly increased serum concentrations of ccl11 with age in both, pxe patients and healthy controls. this is in accordance with previous studies showing an increase of serum ccl11 concentration with age [34, 36]. furthermore, our study showed no significant differences in ccl11 serum concentrations between pxe patients and healthy controls. elevated ccl11 serum concentrations are associated with different stages of agerelated macular degeneration (amd), except for neovascular amd. patients with neovascular amd showed, like pxe patients in our study, normal ccl11 serum concentrations compared to healthy controls . this matches the fact that the vision impairments of pxe patients show similarities like choroidal neovascularization (cnv) with neovascular amd [7, 3840]. another intensively discussed aging biomarker is gdf11, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily and closely related to myostatin (gdf8). gdf11 plays a role in mammalian development and was claimed to have anti-aging effects [22, 24, 41]. we have seen a minor decrease in gdf11 serum concentrations with age and between pxe and healthy controls, though these changes did not reach statistical significance. previous studies investigating age dependent gdf11 blood level showed controversial results possibly due to specifity and selectivity of detection methods and to potential low overall gdf11 serum concentration [24, 33, 42-44]. although, there was not always strictly distinguished between gdf8 and gdf11, some studies reported an overall decrease of gdf11 or gdf11/8 concentrations in the bloodstream with increasing age [24, 44]. loffredo et al. showed a reduction in gdf11 serum concentrations and proved that recombinant gdf11 can reverse age-related cardiac hypertrophy in mice . in 2015, a study by olsen et al. confirmed this by linking decreasing gdf11/8 levels to higher risks of cardiovascular events and death . as we could not detect any significant changes in gdf11 serum concentrations for pxe patients, it could be suggested that circulating gdf11 plays only a minor role in pxe or agerelated pathogenesis going along with it. these ambiguous results rather raised the question whether local and not systemic gdf11 concentrations are relevant in pxe. we, therefore, measured gdf11 mrna expression in human dermal fibroblasts from pxe patients as well as in nhdf and found a significant reduction in mrna expression in pxe fibroblasts compared to nhdf. unfortunately, determination of gdf11 levels in cell culture supernatants was not possible due to low protein concentrations. however, previous studies showed a decreased gdf11 mrna and protein expression in spleen could be associated with age in mice . it was proposed that gdf11 expression in spleen is rather high compared to other tissues and may primarily contribute to circulating gdf11 concentrations . thus, the decreased gdf11 mrna expression in pxe fibroblasts do not necessarily correlate with detected circulating gdf11 levels. this probably strengthen the assumption that autocrine or paracrine effects of aberrant locally expressed gdf11 levels could be more important for pxe pathogenesis in affected tissues than circulating gdf11. tiemann j., et al linking abcc6 deficiency to premature aging aging and disease volume 11, number 3, june 2020 8 figure 5. male and female specific igfbp3 mrna expression and protein concentration.

(d) igfbp3 protein concentration in supernatant of male pxe fibroblasts (grey) and nhdf (white). data are shown as mean ± sem. control/pxe: p≤0.01; ns p>0.05. a third protein which is closely associated with aging is igf1. igf1 plays a wide role in proliferation and tissue growth and is known as an anti-aging factor (, reviewed in ). igf1 serum levels peak in young adolescents and subsequently declines with age . studies showed that progeroid zmpste24-/mice have a disturbed igf1/growth hormone (gh) ratio with low igf1 plasma concentrations. application of recombinant igf1, normalized igf1/gh ratio and extended the lifespan of zmpste24-/mice . measuring total serum igf1 concentrations in pxe patients and controls, we found no statistical significant changes with age as the variances of individuals in each group may mask the expected age associated decline of total igf1 levels. apart from this no significant differences were seen between pxe and control cohorts. as the main source for circulating igf1 is the liver direct effects of abcc6 deficiency on expression and secretion of it are unlikely. the majority of circulating igf1 is bound to igfbp3 which strictly controls igf1 availability (reviewed in ). additionally, studies showed an increase in igfbp3 expression in old nhdf as well as in senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells compared to young non senescent cells [28, 50]. we found that igfbp3 serum levels in pxe and control sera showed no significant difference with age, but a significant increase in pxe patients over 45 years compared to the appropriate control cohort. by calculating the molar igf1/igfbp3 ratio it could be suggested that less circulating free igf1 tiemann j., et al linking abcc6 deficiency to premature aging aging and disease volume 11, number 3, june 2020 9 is present in pxe patients over 45 years compared to healthy controls. this possibly results in a reduced igf1 signaling in peripheral tissues which supports the hypothesis of an accelerated aging process in pxe patients. in addition, studies also showed that locally expressed igfbp3 may have paracrine or autocrine effects on tissue specific igf1 signaling as local igfbp3 expression can differ from circulating serum concentrations . we measured igfbp3 mrna expression and protein concentration in supernatants of primary human dermal fibroblasts of pxe patients and healthy controls to evaluate tissue specific igfbp3 expression. both, mrna expression and protein analysis showed an overall decrease in pxe fibroblasts compared to nhdf. interestingly, mrna expression and protein concentrations in supernatants showed opposed results in males and females with decreased expression in males and no changes for females. one has to mention that the fibroblasts from male pxe donors are derived from different skin areas as the control fibroblasts and the fibroblasts from the female pxe donor. thus, instead of gender associated reasons, the observed opposed results could, thus, be also derived from different expression patterns due to the biopsy source. nevertheless, results from oliver et al. support the gender specific expression of igfbp3 as they showed decreased igfbp3 protein expression in male and even no change of protein expression in female igf1 overexpressing skeletal muscle of old mice compared to younger ones . they also showed that this sexual dimorphism was not due to a different response to locally overexpressed igf1 but to alternative age and gender dependent factors . contrary to their results, we did not only see differences in protein concentration but also distinct mrna expression between genders which could be related to tissue specific regulation. thus, we see a decreased igfbp3 mrna expression in pxe fibroblasts of males and no significant changes in female pxe fibroblasts compared to nhdf. a study of lovqist et al. showed increased igfbp3 mrna expression in retinal vasculature under conditions of hypoxia . they assumed a protective function of igfbp3 contributed to the prevention of oxygen-induced vessel loss and abnormal neovascularization . low tissue specific igfbp3 concentrations could, possibly, promote cnv when also found in retinal tissue. cnv is a prominent clinical manifestation seen in pxe patients [7, 8, 39]. surprisingly, the observed sexual dimorphism showed only low tissue specific igfbp3 expression in males although it is often reported that females are predominantly affected by pxe . at first sight, the results for tissue specific expression did not match the results obtained by the measurement of serum igfbp3 levels showing increased igfbp3 concentrations for pxe patients compared to healthy controls. as far more females than males were tested for igfbp3 serum levels this may explain why an increase rather than a decrease was seen for igfbp3 serum concentrations. additionally, the other tested biomarkers showed no gender specific expression patterns which demonstrated that this potential sexual dimorphism probably only applies for selected targets and is not a general phenomenon. nevertheless, our results show that abcc6 deficiency may lead to aberrant igfbp3 mrna and protein expression in pxe fibroblasts associated with potential gender specific aging processes, again, strengthen the assumption of an accelerated aging process in pxe patients. furthermore, it underlines that an abcc6 deficiency has a direct influence on affected peripheral tissues. this is the first study linking abcc6 deficiency to aberrant systemic and especially local concentrations of aging biomarkers in peripheral tissues. these findings could be associated with a potential premature aging process in pxe patients and particularly in affected peripheral tissues. as a result of this, it should be considered that clinical manifestation seen in pxe patients, like visual impairments or soft tissue calcification which are, thusfar, claimed to be direct results of aberrant concentrations of the unknown abcc6 substrate, could also be indirect consequences caused by premature aging processes induced by e.g. an aberrant lipid metabolism due to abcc6 deficiency . competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests. acknowledgements this study was supported by a forum research grant (k107-16) of the
